Psalm is a static analysis tool for finding errors in PHP applications.

## Installation

To get started, check out the [installation guide](docs/running_psalm/installation.md).

## Details about this fork

This was customized for a narrow use case. It differs from the upstream repo psalm/psalm in the following ways:

- Hardcoded support for [runkit/runkit7 superglobals](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/runkit.configuration.php#ini.runkit.superglobal).
  Right now, it hardcodes the assumption that `$_TAG` is a superglobal of the union type `tag_global`
  That can easily be changed to be configurable.
- PossiblyNullReference is disabled for nullable union types containing `User`
- Error tolerance. This will proceed with analysis in many cases, whether or not a previous error was suppressed.
- It adds `--no-vendor-autoloader` (may be broadly useful)
